    "summary": "I am a solution-focused Senior Frontend Engineer based in Dallas, TX, bridging the gap between engineering feasibility and user experience. My journey spans from building high-volume e-commerce platforms for Walmart to designing life-saving healthcare tools at UMass Dartmouth. Most recently, I launched DiaFriend, a not-for-profit diabetes management app featured in UMass News for its impact on the SouthCoast Portuguese community. Whether I'm architecting micro-frontends at Point B or developing predictive algorithms for my Master's thesis, my goal remains the same: building technology that works for people.",
